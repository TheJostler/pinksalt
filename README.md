Can you store information in a salted password hash?

This is a simple program that is the result of a thought experiment I had, it tests the idea of storing simple information into a password hash.

This could be used to make information even more private and secure as the information is not really being stored
in a way that can be decrypted. 

The information must to attained through a brute force password attack and this is only really practical if
the original password is known!
